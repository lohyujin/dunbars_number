# Dunbar's Number

Suggest a cognitive limit to the number of connection one can maintain a stable relationship. Here stable is defined as follows:

1. Able to identify the person's full name
2. Maintained contact in the past one year OR One does not feel awkward calling the other party out in the public

Evidently, 150 is the magic number.
